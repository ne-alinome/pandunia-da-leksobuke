== Target formats

At the moment, the original data file is converted into the following formats:

|===
| Format                            | Filename extension

| Asciidoctor                       | adoc
| DICT protocol dictionary database | dict.dz
| DocBook                           | xml
| EPUB                              | epub
| OpenDocument                      | odt
| Plain text                        | txt
| Rich Text Format                  | rtf
|===

More formats will be added in the future.

== How to make the target files

First make sure the following programs are installed in your system:

- asciidoctor
- awk
- dictfmt
- make
- pandoc

Then enter the project directory and give the proper command:

|===
| Command               | Effect

| `make`                | Make all formats
| `make all`            | Make all formats
| `make adoc`           | Make only Asciidoctor
| `make dict`           | Make only DICT
| `make epub`           | Make only EPUB
| `make odt`            | Make only ODT
| `make rtf`            | Make only RTF
| `make txt`            | Make only plain text
| `make xml`            | Make only DocBook
| `sudo make install`   | Install the dict
| `sudo make uninstall` | Uninstall the dict
|===

== How to use the dict format

After making (`make dict`) and installing (`sudo make install`) the
dict-format dictionary, you can use dict as usual. Examples:

- List the available dictionaries with `dict -D`. You must see the
  "pandunia" dictionary in the list.
- Consult a Pandunia word with `dict -d pandunia WORD`.
- Request information on the dictionary with `dict -i pandunia`.

Read the dict's documentation for more details and search options.

A simple shell wrapper is provided in <src/pandunia.sh>. You can copy
that file to a location in your path, e.g. as <\~/bin/pandunia> or
</usr/local/bin/pandunia>. Then the command `pandunia` will be
equivalent to `dict -d pandunia`.
